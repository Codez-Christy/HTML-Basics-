 <h1>My Personal blog</h1>  
</body><p>O God of all creation
    Bless this our land and nation
    Justice be our shield and defender
    May we dwell in unity
    Peace and liberty
    Plenty be found within our borders.<br>Let one and all arise
    With hearts both strong and true
    Service be our earnest endeavour
    And our homeland of Kenya
    Heritage and splendour
    Firm may we stand to defend</p>
