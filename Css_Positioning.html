    <!-- Css Posiioning -->


    <!-- CSS positioning is a crucial aspect of web design that allows you yo control the placement
        of elements on a web page. There are several CSS properties for positioning, including float, position,
        and display. Let's Explore each of them


        1. Float
        ->:The float property is used to move an element to the left or right, allowing content to flow
        around it. It's often used for creating multi-column layouts or wrapping text around images.


        ->:Elements with float applied are taken out of the normal document flow and moved to the left or right
        until they encounter the edge of their containing element or another floated element.


        ->:Common values for float are left and right.


        ->:It's important to clear floats using the clear property on elements following the floated elements
        to prevent layout issues


        2. Position
        ->:The position property allows you to control the positioning of an element relative to its containing
        element. it offers several value:
            *static(Default): The element follows the normal flow of the document.
            *relative: The element's position is relative to it's normal position.
            *absolute: The element's position is relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
            *fixed: The element's position is relative to the viewport(stays in the same place even when scrolling).


        3. Display
        ->:The display property controls the rendering behavior of an element. It can change an elements display
        from the default block or inline to other values like inline-block or none.


        ->:Common values include:
            *block: Elements are displayed as a block-level element, occupying the full width of their parent and
            stacking vertically.
            *inline: Elements are displayed as inline elements, stacking horizontally.
            *inline-block: Elements are displayed as inline elements, but you can contol their width, height,
            and margin.
            *none: Elements are hidden, effectively removing them from the layout.
            *flex and grid: Enable advanced layout options, such as creating flexible boxes and grid layouts.
